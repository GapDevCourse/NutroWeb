Helloo! This is Kiran.I am an AIML student and  I love experimenting with algorithms, building models, and applying AI/ML techniques to solve real-world problems. 
I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative projects, contribute to open-source initiatives, and learn from others in the AI/ML community.
